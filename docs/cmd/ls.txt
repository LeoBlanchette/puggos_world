	
List Directory
...lists folders and files in a given directory. Folders are green, files are blue.
	
[color=green]/ls[/color] 
...will list files in your present working directory (/pwd)
	
[color=green]/ls[/color] [color=yellow]<target directory>[/color]
...will list files in the target directory specified.
	
Please note that files will show a .remap or .import (light gray) suffix. This is 
because you are browsing imported content. However the lighter colored text such
as "texture.png" represents the file that successfully imported. You may ignore the ".import"
suffix in "texture.png.import".
	
[color=yellow]Special note:[/color] The [color=green]/ls[/color], [color=green]/cd[/color], and [color=green]/pwd[/color] commands don't require a forward slash when
working in the console. These commands were included so that modders can easily 
verify how their content is being imported into the game.
