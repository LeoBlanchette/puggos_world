[color=yellow]Special note:[/color] The [color=green]/ls[/color], [color=green]/cd[/color], and [color=green]/pwd[/color] commands don't require a forward slash when
working in the console. These commands were included so that modders can easily 
verify how their content is being imported into the game.
