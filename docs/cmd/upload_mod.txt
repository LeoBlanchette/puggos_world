[color=yellow]IMPORTANT[/color]
It will work if you set it up properly. You must run the command with an 
absolute path to the folder containing the mod like so:
	
[color=green]/upload_mod[/color] C:\Users\thesw\Desktop\PW-MODS\more_books
	

Afterward, go to your steam account and finish preparing the mod on their system / UI.
	
The folder sould be structure like this:

<mod_folder>

	- the-mod.pck
	- preview.png
	- meta.cfg
	

...where preview.png is the 960x540 preview image that will be uploaded to steam.
...and meta.cfg is the resource / config file created by the SDK on export.
