Need to know which slots are which? 
Run [color=green]/list_slots[/color] to see which slots contain 
which items.

ADMINS / SERVER:

Need to target a player for unequipping an item? 
First, find their peer id:
	
[color=green]/list_players[/color] 
	
Then:
	
[color=green]/unequip[/color] <slot> [color=yellow]--pid[/color] <peer_id>

... Will target the player for an unequip operation.
