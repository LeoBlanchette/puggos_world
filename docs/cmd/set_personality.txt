	
Sets a personality (which is an idle animation that kicks in after idling after
so much time)
	
[color=green]/set_personality[/color] <item id>
	
...where the <item id> is an animation id that can be found by running:
	
[color=green]/print_index[/color]
	
All personalities have their name beginning with "personality_"
	
To verify a valid personality animation, you can also run 
	
[color=green]/print_object_meta items <item_id>[/color]
	
If the output contains "personality" as a meta key, it is a valid personality.
