	
Equips an item to a character slot. 
	
If you are modding and are trying out items via the command line, 
then you should use this workflow:
	
[color=green]/equip[/color] <id>
	
Example:
	
[color=green]/equip[/color] 22 
	
...which at this time should place a police hat on the character.
	
[color=green]/print_index[/color] will provide a list of item ids that exist.
Not all item IDs can be equipped obviously, as some of them are animations.
	
ADMINS / SERVER:

Need to target a player for equipping an item? 
First, find their peer id:
	
[color=green]/list_players[/color] 
	
Then:
	
[color=green]/equip[/color] <id> [color=yellow]--pid[/color] <peer_id>

... Will target the player for an equip operation.
